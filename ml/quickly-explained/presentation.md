# What is ML?

- Algorithms...
- that are not (directly) coded but trained...
- using data...
- to answer questions.

???

- There are tasks that are too hard to code manually
- Now, ML creats models that we are not able to understand

---

# What are useful for?

- Recommendations
- Predictions
- Inference/Recognition/Detection
- ...

???

- Recommendations: Amazon, Facebook (ads), ...
- Predictions: Facebook (ads), ...
- Recognition: Google (understading text), ...
- Inference: Heliocentric (science!), ...

# How they work?

- Gather data (LOTS)
- Train
- Test
- Repeat

???

- Data:
  - Gather
  - Prepare (training and evaluation sets)
- Training:
  - Choose a model
  - Train
  - Tune parameters
- Result: model
- Big data:
  - Captcha
  - Social networks
  - Warning: data can be biased
- Approches:
  - Genetic/evolutionary
  - Neural networks

# How can I train one?

- Tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- Gorgonia

---

# Demo time
